It focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn.
Over time, machine learning improves its accuracy through experience.
Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are its main types.
Machine learning has applications in healthcare, finance, and marketing."""

It uses artificial neural networks with many layers.
Deep learning models can perform tasks like image and speech recognition.
They require large datasets and significant computing power.
Training deep networks often involves backpropagation and gradient descent."""

NLP involves tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and summarization.
Techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization are essential.
Recent advances in NLP are powered by transformer models.
